## Development Methodology

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.

Every feature has:
- `specs.md` — Full technical specification
- `requirements.md` — Implementation acceptance checklist
- `prompt.md` — Ready-to-use implementation prompt

## Features (0)


## Getting Started

1. Read this file for project context
2. Check `specs/.devx/workflow.md` for the development workflow
3. Review `specs/.devx/instruction.md` for architecture and multi-repo rules
4. Pick a feature from `specs/.devx/features.json`
5. Open the feature's `prompt.md` and use it with your AI assistant
6. Follow the spec and requirements to implement

    prompt.md            ← Implementation prompt
```

## AI Tool Setup

Run the init script to configure your AI tools automatically:

```bash
bash ./specs/.devx/init.sh
```

If you want execute permissions as well:

```bash
  chmod +x ./specs/.devx/init.sh && ./specs/.devx/init.sh
```

The script lists supported AI tools, lets you choose one, and creates only that tool's config files.
