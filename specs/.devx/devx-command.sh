Read AGENTS.md and the local handoff files first:

- specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-guidelines.md when present

Selected feature slug: $slug
Selected feature title: $title

You must only implement this selected feature:
- Specs: $specs_path
- Requirements: $requirements_path
- Prompt: $prompt_path


Strict guardrails:
- Do not infer the feature from the currently open editor tab.
- Do not implement DevX tooling, init.sh, specs generation, workspace bootstrap, or unrelated specs unless this selected feature explicitly requires it.
- Do not modify other feature folders except when a shared implementation file must change to satisfy this feature.
- Inspect existing code paths from the change map before creating an implementation plan.
- When Golden Repo guidance exists (specs/.devx/guidance/ or the specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/ golden files), you MUST read it and reconcile each cross-cutting convention (e.g. CSRF synchronizer tokens, i18n/resource files, the UI design system/tokens): apply it, or mark it not-applicable-to-this-stack with a one-line rationale, and include a short "Golden Repo Reconciliation" note. Verified local patterns override golden guidance on conflict.
- Read this feature's Open Questions (specs/.devx/features.json openQuestions[], or the "## Open Questions" section in $specs_path). Surface the consolidated list and ask the human user for a decision before coding, apply their answer, and record the decision plus a one-line rationale in specs/$slug/assumptions.md — never assume silently or invent behavior. A feature held at status needs-clarification (tracker NEEDS_CLARIFICATION) has an unresolved blocking question and must be resolved and re-enabled (set back to not-started/PENDING) before implementing.
- Create an implementation plan before editing.
- Implement one item from the implementation acceptance checklist at a time.
- If $requirements_path contains spec-quality PASS/FAIL validation results instead of implementation acceptance criteria, stop and ask the user to regenerate or repair the spec bundle.
- Validate the implementation against every item in $requirements_path.

- If all implementation acceptance items pass (and, when Golden Repo artifacts exist, the Golden Repo Reconciliation note was produced, and every blocking Open Question is resolved and recorded in specs/$slug/assumptions.md), update only this feature's status in specs/.devx/features.json to "done" and its entry in specs/.devx/tracker.json to "COMPLETED" with a fresh updatedAt timestamp.

Now read the selected feature files and begin with the implementation plan.

Validate this selected feature only:
- Slug: $slug
- Title: $title
- Specs: $specs_path
- Requirements: $requirements_path

Validation rules:
- Check every implementation acceptance item in $requirements_path.
- If $requirements_path contains spec-quality PASS/FAIL validation results instead of implementation acceptance criteria, stop and report that the spec bundle must be regenerated or repaired.
- Verify behavior in actual implementation code, not just file existence.
- Verify the implementation follows local project context and existing-code constraints.
- Report PASS/FAIL for each implementation acceptance item.
- Do not mark the feature done unless every implementation acceptance item passes.
- Do not validate unrelated features.

  cat <<PROMPT
Read AGENTS.md and local handoff files before each feature:
- specs/.devx/project-context.md
- specs/.devx/current-state.md
- specs/.devx/implementation-check.md
- specs/.devx/change-maps/<slug>.md
- specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-guidelines.md when present

Run DevX autopilot code generation.

Scope:
- Maximum features this session: $max_features
- Source of truth: specs/.devx/features.json, specs/.devx/tracker.json, and each specs/<slug>/ folder

Mandatory loop:
1. Pick the first feature whose tracker status is "PENDING". Skip any feature whose specs/<slug>/ folder is not present in this checkout (features are pushed selectively) - note the skipped slug in your output and move on to the next PENDING feature. A not-present folder is expected and is not an error; never modify or remove its features.json/tracker.json entry. Also skip any feature whose status is needs-clarification (tracker NEEDS_CLARIFICATION) - it has an unresolved blocking Open Question; report it and leave its entry untouched.
2. Read its local handoff context, change map, specs.md, requirements.md, prompt.md, and tdd-tests.md when present.
2a. When Golden Repo guidance exists (specs/.devx/guidance/ or the specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/ golden files), you MUST read it and reconcile each cross-cutting convention (e.g. CSRF synchronizer tokens, i18n/resource files, the UI design system/tokens): apply it, or mark it not-applicable-to-this-stack with a one-line rationale, and include a short "Golden Repo Reconciliation" note. Verified local patterns override golden guidance on conflict.
3. Read this feature's Open Questions (specs/.devx/features.json openQuestions[], or the "## Open Questions" section in that feature's specs.md). This is an unattended run: do NOT pause to ask. For each Open Question, choose a reasonable assumption and record the decision plus a one-line rationale in specs/<slug>/assumptions.md before coding - never assume silently or invent behavior. (Blocking questions are already held at needs-clarification and skipped in step 1.)
4. Inspect existing code before editing and verify change-map suggestions in the actual workspace.
5. Implement only that feature, one implementation acceptance item at a time.
6. Validate every implementation acceptance item against actual implementation code.
7. If requirements.md contains spec-quality PASS/FAIL validation results instead of implementation acceptance criteria, stop and ask the user to regenerate or repair the spec bundle.
8. If all implementation acceptance items pass (and, when Golden Repo artifacts exist, the Golden Repo Reconciliation note was produced, and every blocking Open Question is resolved and recorded in specs/<slug>/assumptions.md), mark only that feature as "done" in specs/.devx/features.json and "COMPLETED" in specs/.devx/tracker.json.
9. Stop if tracking becomes dirty, validation fails repeatedly, or the max feature limit is reached.

Do not start new work while uncommitted or unpushed code or tracking changes exist.
