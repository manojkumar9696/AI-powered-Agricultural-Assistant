# /ui-design — Implement UI Design From Specs

> Translate feature specs into intentional, accessible, and verifiable UI implementation.

## Golden Repo Guidance (read and reconcile)

- When Golden Repo artifacts exist (`specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-guidelines.md`, `specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-sources.md`, or `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-system.md`, `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-sources.md`), you MUST read them before implementing. This is REQUIRED, not optional.
- The Golden Repo may describe a different stack than this app; do NOT apply it blindly. For each cross-cutting convention it defines (for example security/CSRF synchronizer tokens, internationalization/resource files, and the prescribed UI design system/tokens), EITHER apply it OR record it as not-applicable-to-this-stack with a one-line rationale.
- Produce a short "Golden Repo Reconciliation" note in your output: for each convention, list Applied or Not-applicable with the rationale.
- Verified local workspace patterns override Golden Repo guidance when they conflict.
- Never set a feature to `done`/`COMPLETED` when Golden Repo artifacts exist unless this read-and-reconcile was completed and the reconciliation note was produced.

## Inputs

- Required: `specs/.devx/features.json`
- Required: `specs/<slug>/specs.md`
- Required: `specs/<slug>/requirements.md`
- Optional: `specs/<slug>/tdd-tests.md` when TDD is enabled
- Required: `specs/.devx/project-context.md`
- Required: `specs/.devx/current-state.md`
- Required: `specs/.devx/implementation-check.md`
- Required: `specs/.devx/change-maps/<slug>.md`
- Required when present: `specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-guidelines.md`
- Required when present: `specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-sources.md`
- Required when present: `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-system.md` (the Golden Repo UI design system/tokens)
- Required when present: `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-sources.md` for exact Golden Repo source excerpts

## Design Objectives

- Preserve the product hierarchy and user flow described in the spec.
- Ensure UI states are complete: loading, empty, error, success, and partial-data states where relevant.
- Keep component behavior deterministic and testable from acceptance criteria.
- Maintain consistency with existing tokens, spacing, typography, and interaction patterns.
- When local Golden Repo UI artifacts exist, read them before implementation and use them as the UI/UX reference source.
- Existing UI patterns in the target workspace override generic or Golden Repo guidance when they conflict.

## Workflow

1. Read the feature context:
  - Open `specs/.devx/features.json` and locate the target slug
  - Open `specs/.devx/project-context.md`, `specs/.devx/current-state.md`, and `specs/.devx/change-maps/<slug>.md`
  - Read `specs/<slug>/specs.md` and `specs/<slug>/requirements.md`
  - Extract user scenarios and acceptance criteria before writing code

2. Extract UI obligations from the spec:
  - Capture required user flows and states (empty/loading/error/success)
  - Identify accessibility requirements, labels, and keyboard interactions
  - Identify UI-observable acceptance criteria and edge cases
  - Map each requirement to concrete UI sections/components

3. Read and reconcile local Golden Repo UI guidance when present (REQUIRED, not optional):
  - Read `specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-guidelines.md` for cross-cutting implementation conventions
  - Use `specs/.devx/guidance/golden-repo-sources.md` for exact source excerpts and file-path attribution
  - Read `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-system.md` first (the prescribed UI design system/tokens)
  - Use `specs/.devx/skills/ui-design/golden-ui-design-sources.md` for exact source excerpts and file-path attribution
  - The Golden Repo may target a different stack: for each convention, EITHER apply it OR record it not-applicable-to-this-stack with a one-line rationale, and include a short "Golden Repo Reconciliation" note in your output. Verified local UI patterns override golden guidance on conflict
  - Do not require live Golden Repository access inside the implementation workspace

4. Plan implementation:
  - Identify which existing shared components should be reused
  - Identify where new components are justified and keep them small/single-purpose
  - Define interaction contracts (inputs, outputs, events, disabled/loading states)
  - Define responsive behavior at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

5. Implement with existing project patterns:
  - Reuse established component primitives and layout conventions
  - Keep token usage, spacing, and typography consistent with project style
  - Avoid introducing behavior not described in specs or requirements
  - Keep labels, helper text, and empty/error copy clear and action-oriented

6. Accessibility pass:
  - Ensure semantic landmarks and control labels are present
  - Verify keyboard navigation and focus visibility for all interactive elements
  - Ensure status/error messages are announced appropriately
  - Verify color contrast and non-color state indicators

6. Validate outcomes:
  - Cross-check each UI requirement in `requirements.md`
  - Confirm responsive behavior and readable hierarchy
  - Confirm form semantics, focus order, and accessible naming
  - Confirm no orphan interactions (buttons/links with no valid action path)

## Acceptance Mapping Checklist

For each requirement in `requirements.md`, record:

- Requirement reference
- Implemented UI location (component/screen/section)
- Expected interaction/state
- Validation note (how you confirmed behavior)

## Output Format

After implementation, provide a concise report:

1. Components changed/added
2. Requirements covered (requirement-to-UI mapping)
3. Accessibility checks completed
4. Responsive checks completed
5. Known gaps (if any) requiring clarification

## Rules

- Follow the spec strictly; do not invent extra UI workflows.
- Keep UI states explicit and testable.
- Prefer project-standard components over custom one-off patterns.
- When uncertain, prioritize acceptance criteria over stylistic preference.
- If spec and existing UI patterns conflict, flag the conflict and ask before deviating.
